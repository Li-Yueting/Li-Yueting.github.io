Hi! I’m Yueting, an EECS PhD student at UC Berkeley. Many people find it hard to pronounce my name, and I also go by the name of Lily! Currently, I’m doing research in analog integrated circuits (IC) for biomedical applications and inverse designs for IC, as well as brain pattern-related machine learning. I'm very interested in working on analog/mixed-signal integrated circuits and their design methodologies, as well as neuroscience. If you want to collaborate or reach out, please find me via *yueting_li@berkeley.edu*!
