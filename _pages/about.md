Hi! I’m Yueting, an EECS PhD student at UC Berkeley. Many people found it's hard to pronounce my name, and I go by the name of Lily as well! Currently, I’m doing research in open hardware, analog VLSI circuit place & route automation as well as brain pattern-related machine learning. I'm very interested in working on analog/mixed-signal integrated circuits and their design methodologies, as well as neuroscience. If you want to reach out, you can find me via *yueting_li@berkeley.edu*!
