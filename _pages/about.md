Hi! I’m Yueting, an EE graduate student at the Stanford University in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.stanford.edu/). Many people found it's hard to pronounce my name, and I go by the name of Lily as well! Currently I’m doing research in open hardware, analog VLSI circuit place & route automation as well as in brain pattern related machine learning. I'm very interested in working on VLSI analog/mixed-signal circuits, as well as design methodologies in the future. **I'm actively looking for 2023 spring/fall PhD positions.** If you find me a good fit, please feel free to reach out!
